### Overview

This project uses [daily weather data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ankushnarwade/indian-climate-dataset-20242025), sourced from Kaggle, of major cities in India between January 2024 and December 2025 and includes weather features such as amount of rainfall, humidity and temperature.

The objective of this project is to clean and explore the data, produce key insights from exploratory data analysis and use different machine learning techniques for time-series forecasting. Currently, I am still working on different parts of the project.
