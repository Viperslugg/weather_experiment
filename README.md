### Overview

This project uses [raw weather data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ankushnarwade/indian-climate-dataset-20242025) from major cities in India between January 2024 and December 2025. As I have downloaded the data on 15 December 2025, weather data after 14 December 2025 will not be available but does not affect the project.

The objective of this project is to clean and explore the data, produce key insights from exploratory data analysis and use different machine learning techniques for time-series forecasting. The main language used is Python for this project.
